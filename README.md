# 👗 Fashion MNIST Classification using Transfer Learning 
This project applies **Transfer Learning** to classify images from the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. It demonstrates how pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for accurate fashion item recognition.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories (such as T-shirts, sneakers, bags, and coats).  
Instead of training a deep learning model from scratch, this project uses **transfer learning** to leverage the power of pre-trained models, improving accuracy and reducing training time.

## 🗂 Dataset  
- **Fashion MNIST** (by Zalando)  
- 60,000 training images & 10,000 test images  
- Each image: 28x28 grayscale  
- 10 classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot

## 🔧 Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Normalization & reshaping of images  
   - Train-test split  

2. **Transfer Learning**  
   - Pre-trained CNN architecture used  
   - Custom classification head added  
   - Fine-tuning for Fashion MNIST classes  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Optimizers & loss functions tested  
   - Accuracy and loss monitored  
   - Confusion matrix for performance insights  

---

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved high accuracy on test data  
- Improved generalization using transfer learning  
- Visualized predictions and misclassifications

# ✨ Key Learnings
Transfer learning speeds up training and improves performance.

Visual analysis helps understand model weaknesses.

Fashion MNIST is a good benchmark for experimenting with CNNs.

# 📌 Future Work
Experiment with other pre-trained models (ResNet, EfficientNet).

Apply data augmentation for robustness.

Deploy the model as a web app.
